<body>I love wizards
wizards are real, I'm sure of it.
I've seen a few myself.
Here's a Haiku about wizards
<h1>Smoke rings and fireworks
A wizard arrives just in time
Though not sure why</h1>
<h2> Wizards can cast spells, use forces, do magic, and hold an extreme wisdom.
	here is a cool image of a wizard. </h2>
